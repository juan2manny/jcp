            Worked in an Agile development environment developing and maintaining multiple USAF/DoD high visibility,
            mission critical, React and Angular applications from proof of concept through Production.Acted as SME for
            software factory employees to assist and guide development on modernization effort of a mission critical

            design engineer implementing modular development practices allowing the team to create reusable components
            that were capable of addressing various use cases.Primary front-end developer on 3-4 person team developing
            enterprise level, cross browser, on-demand services. Spearheaded the drive to move away from existing
            practices and convert a major project to a more centralized, maintainable, and internally beneficial
            software model. This conversion has reduced maintenance overhead dramatically and has now become the
            de-facto model for new development within the team. Led the development team to explore (and ultimately
            adopt) a new front-end framework for enterprise applications, resulting in faster, more reliable deployment
            cycles. The performance increase allowed the development team to handle more projects without increasing
            total workload and ultimately reduced overhead per sprint.
